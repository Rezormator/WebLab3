    </h2>
</div>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        The Last of Us Part II Remastered launches January 19, and we here at Naughty Dog are so thrilled to offer new
        and returning players the definitive way to experience Ellie and Abby’s story. Coupled with new
        behind-the-scenes features and new modes, Part II Remastered is intended to let players dive deeper into the
        story and gameplay than they ever have before.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ahead of launch later this week, we’re excited to showcase a new features trailer, that digs a little further
        into all the ways The Last of Us Part II Remastered enhances the original release.
    </p>
    <p>
        For returning players who have been waiting to jump into the remastered version the $10 upgrade will be
        available as Part II Remastered launches! If you’re an existing digital or physical owner of The Last of Us Part
        II on the PlayStation 4 console, head on over to the PlayStation Store as soon as Part II Remastered is
        available to purchase the upgrade. If you own The Last of Us Part II via a disc, you must insert disc copies
        into your PS5 via a disc drive to download and play the digital version of The Last of Us Part II Remastered.
        You’ll be able to import existing saves from the original PS4 game and pick up from where you left off. Existing
        Trophy progress will also migrate to The Last of Us Part II Remastered.
    </p>
    <h1>No Return mode</h1>
    <p>
        Speaking of trophies, Part II Remastered’s exciting new single-player roguelike survival mode No Return comes
        with its own set of new trophies that should encourage you to dig into everything the mode has to offer. With a
        roster of 10 characters, including some never before playable in the world of The Last of Us, new gameplay mods,
        and so much more, we’re thrilled for all of you to jump into this new addition to the world of The Last of Us.
        No Return also integrates a number of Part II Remastered’s accessibility features, and combined with the ability
        to create custom runs that allow you to take on runs as you see fit, we look forward to hearing about your time
        with No Return.

        And before you kick off your first No Return run, be sure to check out our primer on the roguelike survival mode
        new to The Last of Us Part II Remastered. We can’t wait to see how your Daily Run scores stack up against others
        on the leaderboards!

    <h1>Guitar Free Play and more features</h1>
    <p>
        While No Return is designed to let players engage with The Last of Us Part II Remastered’s combat on a deeper
        level, it’s one of several new features included in Part II Remastered. Be sure to watch the features trailer
        above if you haven’t already for a rundown of the full experience, which also includes Guitar Free Play. This
        mode will let you fully immerse yourself in our guitar-playing minigame while you play as Joel, Ellie, and The
        Last of Us composer Gustavo Santaolalla, and strum on the guitar, banjo, and steel resonator. Use FX pedals to
        modulate your performance, and test out your musical expertise with a fan favorite feature we’re so happy to
        spotlight in its own mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        Part II Remastered features new additions to our suite of accessibility features, like Speech to Vibrations and
        Cinematic Descriptions, which we previously included in The Last of Us Part I. We’re excited to bring these
        features to the Part II Remastered experience, as we also are to introduce Speedrun Mode, which we also
        introduced in Part I. We’ve also made some additions like dynamic lighting, Frame Forward, Gaze Direction, and
        new frame and logo options for Photo Mode, and we’re delighted to share that Photo Mode will be usable in No
        Return as well, ensuring you can capture all the unexpected and thrilling moments from your runs.

    <h1>Inside The Last of Us Part II Remastered’s development</h1>
    <p>
        We’ve also included features we hope will give you a deeper appreciation for the game and its development. That
        includes hours of new developer commentary accompanying cinematics from Neil Druckmann, Halley Gross, Laura
        Bailey, Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, and Shannon Woodward. There are also three Lost Levels that show
        early-development slices of levels that didn’t make it into the final game. Those sequences - Boar Hunt, Jackson
        Party, and Sewers - include developer commentary explaining the intention and plans for these sections, which
        you can hear by activating them via interactables strewn throughout these levels.
    </p>
    <p>
        To further offer a glimpse behind-the-scenes of The Last of Us Part II’s production, we’re excited to share that
        Grounded II: Making The Last of Us Part II will be added to The Last of Us Part II Remastered in a post-launch
        update, (release date TBA) and be available to watch online (release date TBA). A sequel to the original
        Grounded documentary for The Last of Us, the documentary will offer an in-depth look at Part II’s original
        development. Stay tuned to Naughty Dog’s social channels for updates on when to expect it.
